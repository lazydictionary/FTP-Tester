## 🎯 What is FTP Testing?

Functional Threshold Power (FTP) is the maximum power a cyclist can sustain for approximately one hour. It's a critical metric used for:
- Setting cycling training zones
- Tracking fitness improvements
- Planning structured workouts
- Measuring cycling performance

## ✨ Features

### 🧪 Two Test Protocols
- **Ramp Test**: Gradual power increases based on current FTP
  - Beginner-friendly progressive format
  - Automatic FTP calculation using 72% of peak power
- **20-Minute Test**: Goal-based testing with multiple protocol options
  - Standard constant power (flat line)
  - Descending intervals (starts high, decreases every 5 minutes)
  - Ascending intervals (starts low, increases every 5 minutes)

### 📊 Real-Time Visualization
- Interactive power graphs with live progress tracking
- Audio and visual cueing so you don't miss the next change in wattage
- Visual markers showing current position and FTP reference points
- Responsive charts that adapt to both test types
- Hover tooltips displaying precise power and time data

### ⏱️ Smart Timer System
- Accurate elapsed/remaining time display
- Play/pause functionality with visual feedback

### 🎉 Results
- Automatic ramp test FTP calculation
- Shows you the correct value to manually enter into the Peloton system

### 🎛️ User Experience
- Light/Dark mode
- Clean, distraction-free testing interface
- Prominent display of the current required wattage

## 📱 Usage Guide

### Setting Up a Test

1. **Choose Your Test Type**:
   - **Ramp Test**: Enter your current FTP (recommended for beginners)
   - **20-Minute Test**: Enter your goal FTP and select a test protocol

2. **Configure Options**:
   - Advanced Settings option to change Ramp test calculation (anywhere from 70%-80% of max output)
   - Select from multiple 20-minute test protocols
   - Choose between light and dark themes
   - 

3. **Start Testing**:
   - Follow the real-time power targets on the graph
   - No standing, if possible - limit to the first 5 minutes of the ramp warmup at most
   - Use the timer controls to pause/resume as needed
   - Monitor your progress with visual indicators

### During the Test

- **Power Display**: Large, clear wattage target
- **Progress Graph**: Real-time visualization of your position
- **Timer Controls**: Easy pause/resume functionality
- **Audio/Visual Cues**: Countdown and beeps will indicate upcoming wattage change

### After the Test

- **Automatic FTP Calculation**: FTP computed based on test protocol
- **Peloton FTP Input**: Shows the number to enter on your Peloton profile for manual FTP adjustments

## 🎯 Test Protocols Explained

### Ramp Test
- **Duration**: Variable (typically 15-25 minutes)
- **Structure**: Power increases every minute by 6%, first five minutes at 46%
- **Calculation**: 72% of the highest 1-minute average
- **Best For**: New cyclists, those who dislike or are afraid of 20-minute tests

### 20-Minute Test
- **Duration**: Exactly 20 minutes
- **Structure**: Various protocols available
- **Calculation**: 95% of 20-minute average power
- **Best For**: Experienced cyclists who know their FTP and fitness well
