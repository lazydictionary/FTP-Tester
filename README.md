# FTP Test App 🚴‍♂️

https://ftp-tester.vercel.app/

A modern, responsive web application for conducting Functional Threshold Power (FTP) tests for cyclists. Simply pull it up on your phone or desktop internet browser and start testing. Choose between a ramp test or traditional 20 minute test.

## 🎯 What is FTP Testing?

Functional Threshold Power (FTP) is the maximum power a cyclist can sustain for approximately one hour. It's a critical metric used for:
- Setting cycling training zones
- Tracking fitness improvements
- Planning structured workouts
- Measuring cycling performance

## ✨ Features

### 🧪 Two Test Protocols
- **Ramp Test**: Gradual power increases based on current FTP
  - Beginner-friendly progressive format
  - Automatic FTP calculation using 72% of peak power
- **20-Minute Test**: Goal-based testing with multiple protocol options
  - Standard constant power (flat line)
  - Descending intervals (starts high, decreases every 5 minutes)
  - Ascending intervals (starts low, increases every 5 minutes)

## 🎯 Test Protocols Explained

### Ramp Test
- **Duration**: Variable (typically 15-25 minutes)
- **Structure**: Power increases every minute by 6%, first five minutes at 46%
- **Calculation**: 72% of highest 1-minute average
