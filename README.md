# FTP Test App 🚴‍♂️

https://ftp-tester.vercel.app/

A modern, responsive web application for conducting Functional Threshold Power (FTP) tests for cyclists. Simply pull it up on your phone or desktop internet browser and start testing. Choose between a ramp test or traditional 20 minute test.

## 🎯 What is FTP Testing?

Functional Threshold Power (FTP) is the maximum power a cyclist can sustain for approximately one hour. It's a critical metric used for:
- Setting cycling training zones
- Tracking fitness improvements
- Planning structured workouts
- Measuring cycling performance

## ✨ Features

### 🧪 Two Test Protocols
- **Ramp Test**: Gradual power increases based on current FTP
  - Beginner-friendly progressive format
  - Automatic FTP calculation using 75% of peak power
- **20-Minute Test**: Goal-based testing with multiple protocol options
  - Standard constant power (flat line)
  - Descending intervals (starts high, decreases every 5 minutes)
  - Ascending intervals (starts low, increases every 5 minutes)

### 📊 Real-Time Visualization
- Interactive power graphs with live progress tracking
- Visual markers showing current position and FTP reference points
- Responsive charts that adapt to both test types
- Hover tooltips displaying precise power and time data

### ⏱️ Smart Timer System
- Accurate elapsed/remaining time display
- Play/pause functionality with visual feedback

### 🎉 Results
- Automatic ramp test FTP calculation
- 20 minute test options always result in your Goal FTP if followed

### 🎛️ User Experience
- Light/Dark mode
- Clean, distraction-free testing interface
- Prominent display of current required Wattage

## 📱 Usage Guide

### Setting Up a Test

1. **Choose Your Test Type**:

## 🎯 Test Protocols Explained

### Ramp Test
- **Duration**: Variable (typically 15-20 minutes)
- **Structure**: Power increases every minute
- **Calculation**: 75% of highest 1-minute average
- **Best For**: New cyclists, fitness testing, time-constrained sessions

### 20-Minute Test
- **Duration**: Exactly 20 minutes
- **Structure**: Various protocols available
- **Calculation**: 95% of 20-minute average power
- **Best For**: Experienced cyclists, precise FTP determination
